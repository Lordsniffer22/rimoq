## Why was my channel Rejected ?
There are different reasons why your channel might have gotten rejected. Here is a summary of the most common reasons:

--The channel had few subscribers

--The channel contains nude/pornographic content

--The channel has been dormant for the past 2 months without a single new post.


If the channel is not falling for these, then it means your channel has been deleting Ads manually for at least three consecutive times.
