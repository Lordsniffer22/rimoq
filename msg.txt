## Why adding the bot as admin in my channel?
In order that we deliver ads and important information about your account to you, adding the bot to the channel as admin is so crucial. We only use the bot to send ads to the channel after getting permission from you.

To add the bot as admin in your channel, you need to be the main admin of that channel.

- Click your channel name and select "Administrators

- Add Admin

- Now search for @adsfybot

- Give "Can Post Messages" Privillage.

--> You are now good to go!


## Why was my channel Rejected ?
There are different reasons why your channel might have gotten rejected. Here is a summary of the most common reasons:

--The channel had few subscribers

--The channel contains nude/pornographic content

--The channel owner dismissed our Bot @adsfybot

--The channel has been dormant for the past 2 months without a single new post.


If the channel is not falling for these, then it means your channel has been deleting Ads manually for at least three consecutive times.
